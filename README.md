The GP Surgery Online Services is a web application that can be used by a GP Surgery to provide its clients with online services.
The user interface has been implemented HTML5, CSS and Bootstrap while the server-side has been developed using PHP. A relational database has been built using MySQL to store the application data. 
Both patients and employees can log in the application by providing their username and password. 
Patients can check GPs and nurses availability, book and cancel appointments, extend some prescriptions and check test results.
Employees can manage patients booking and check the calendar of appointments (per day, week, month).
